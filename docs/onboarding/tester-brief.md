# Nxentra — Tester Brief

Thanks for putting real time into this. Below is everything you need to start. ~5-min read. No commitment beyond playing with it for a few days and telling me what felt wrong.

---

## What Nxentra is, in two sentences

Nxentra is a reconciliation-first accounting platform built for Shopify merchants. The core product question it answers: **"Did all my Shopify revenue actually make it to my bank account, and if not, where is it sitting?"**

## What stage we're at

Pre-release. The reconciliation engine works end-to-end on real data, but the polish is uneven and there are known rough edges. You're testing it before the first paying merchant goes deep — that's why your feedback is valuable now.

## The scenario I'd love you to work through

Pretend you're an e-commerce merchant — or their accountant — at the end of a normal week. You need to answer one question:

> _"Did all this week's Shopify revenue make it to my bank? If something's missing, where is it sitting?"_

If you can answer that question through the platform, the workflow works. If you get stuck, **where you get stuck is exactly the feedback I need.**

You don't need to follow specific steps — explore however feels natural. Operations people read software differently than engineers, and that's the eye I'm asking for.

## How to start

### 1. Register at [app.nxentra.com](https://app.nxentra.com)

On the registration screen, pick these values so the seed data lines up with your tenant config:

| Field | Pick |
|---|---|
| Email | any (e.g. yours with `+heba` alias) |
| Full name | anything (e.g. `TestStore`) |
| Company database name | `TestStore` (or anything; lowercase, no spaces) |
| **Functional currency** | **EGP** |
| Interface language | English |

### 2. Walk through the onboarding wizard

The wizard auto-launches after registration. Pick these:

| Wizard step | What to pick |
|---|---|
| **Business Type** | **Shopify Merchant** (Recommended — auto-configures the retail chart of accounts, Shopify clearing, payment processing fees, etc.) |
| **Company Profile** → Fiscal Year Start Month | **January** |
| **Company Profile** → Date Format | **DD/MM/YYYY** |
| **Company Profile** → Thousands / Decimal | leave defaults (`,` and `.`) |
| **Fiscal Year & Periods** | leave defaults (year `2026`, `12 (Monthly)`, current period auto-detected) |
| **Shopify Setup** | type your Shopify dev store domain (e.g. `mystore.myshopify.com`) → click **Connect to Shopify** → complete OAuth on Shopify → you'll land back on Shopify Setup with a green "Store Connected" checkmark |
| **Import Orders** | **Start fresh — only sync new orders from today** (don't backfill any history; the seed data we'll add later replaces this) |
| **Ready** | click **Go to Dashboard** |

If you don't already have a Shopify dev store, create one for free at [partners.shopify.com](https://partners.shopify.com) — takes ~5 minutes. **Don't create test orders manually** — I'll seed them for you in the next step so they match the CSV pack.

### 3. Ping me on WhatsApp

Once your tenant + Shopify store are connected, message me. I'll:
- Preload 8–10 test Shopify orders (prepaid + COD + 1 refund)
- Send you a CSV pack with three files:
  - `paymob_settlement.csv` (gateway payout statement)
  - `bosta_cod.csv` (courier COD reconciliation report)
  - `bank_statement.csv` (matching bank deposits)

### 4. Upload the three CSVs in order — and watch what changes

Upload one CSV at a time, and **after each upload visit `Finance → Reconciliation` and skim what changed**. The dashboard answers the "where is my money?" question — half the test is whether each upload's effect is visible there.

**Before any upload** — `Finance → Reconciliation` should show your Shopify clearing balances on the left ("expected") and 0.00 settled. Take a quick look so you know the baseline.

**Upload 1: Paymob settlement**
- Go to `Finance → Import Settlements`
- Drop `paymob_settlement.csv` into the **Paymob** uploader (left side)
- Click **Import Paymob CSV**
- Then back to `Finance → Reconciliation` — Paymob's "Settled" column should jump, "Open Balance" should drop. You may see a `Review` badge next to "Paymob Accept" — that's deliberate; flag whether the badge is self-explanatory or confusing.

**Upload 2: Bosta COD settlement**
- Same page (`Finance → Import Settlements`)
- Drop `bosta_cod.csv` into the **Bosta** uploader (right side)
- Click **Import Bosta CSV**
- Back to `Finance → Reconciliation` — Bosta's settled jumps. **You'll likely see a red warning banner** ("Bosta clearing is negative") — that's intentional in the test data: one settlement line refers to an order that doesn't exist in the system. Tell me whether the warning makes sense or feels alarming.

**Upload 3: Bank statement** — `Accounting → Bank Reconciliation → Import Statement`

Form fields:
- **Bank Account**: pick **`11000 — Cash and Bank`** (don't pick Shopify Clearing or Expected Bank Deposit — those are intermediate accounts; the deposit lands in your actual bank account)
- **Statement Date**: set to the latest date in the CSV (e.g. 2026-05-09)
- **Period Start / Period End**: span the dates in the CSV (e.g. 2026-04-30 to 2026-05-09)
- **Currency**: should default to EGP — confirm
- **Opening Balance / Closing Balance**: leave at 0

Then upload the file:

1. Choose `bank_statement.csv` from the file picker
2. Click the **"Map columns"** button (the import doesn't auto-start — this opens the column-mapper dialog)
3. The dialog shows what we auto-detected for each column (Date / Description / Amount / Reference / Debit / Credit) plus a date format. **Trust the auto-detection** — it sniffs the first row of your file. If you override the date format and the import fails ("Parsed 0 lines"), the error message will tell you to revisit the mapping.
4. Click **"Parse with these columns"**
5. Review the parsed-lines preview at the bottom — does it look right? (Date, description, amount, sign of amounts)
6. Click **"Import N lines"**

You'll land on the bank statement detail page with all the imported lines marked **Unmatched**. Don't click "Complete Reconciliation" yet — first:

7. Click the **"Auto-Match"** button at the top of the page. The system tries to match each bank deposit against the settlement JEs you posted earlier. Some will match cleanly (status: `Auto`), some will fall into a **Needs Review** queue (matched within tolerance but the bank received a different amount than expected — e.g. a short-payment), and some will stay **Unmatched** (bank fees, mystery transfers, etc.).
8. Now go to `Finance → Reconciliation`. Stage 3 (Bank Match) shows the result. If anything is in **Needs Review**, you'll see a queue with a reason picker — pick the reason that fits ("Bank charge", "Chargeback", "Rounding", etc.) and click **Resolve**. The system posts an adjustment JE to drain the residual.

**Only after Auto-Match + Needs Review are clean** should you go back to the bank statement page and click "Complete Reconciliation" — that's the final closeout button that locks the period.

### 5. Open the Reconciliation dashboard one more time

`Finance → Reconciliation`. Now try to answer the merchant's question end-to-end:

> *"Did all my Shopify revenue make it to the bank? If anything's missing, where is it sitting?"*

The "Tell me the story" banner at the top of the page should give you a one-sentence answer. If it does — the workflow works. If you can't make sense of what it tells you, or you have to dig through three drilldowns to feel confident, that's exactly the feedback I need.

---

## Other useful screens

The 3 menu paths above are what the scenario uses. If you want to poke around:

- **Journal entries (audit trail of every transaction)** → `Accounting → Journal Entries`
- **Customer / vendor balances** → `Accounting → Customers` / `Vendors`
- **Chart of Accounts** → `Accounting → Chart of Accounts`
- **Shopify orders** → `Shopify → Orders` (or `Records`)

If something's not where you expect it to be, that's worth flagging — discoverability is part of the test.

---

## What to flag as you go

- **Rough edges** — anything broken, slow, ugly, or confusing
- **Missing flows** — "I expected X to be possible here and it wasn't"
- **Wrong language** — copy that doesn't match how merchants/accountants actually talk
- **Workflow mismatches** — "no real merchant would do it this way"
- **Trust issues** — anything that made you hesitate before clicking, or wonder if the number was right

## What NOT to worry about

- Pixel-perfect polish (will come later)
- Missing features that don't block the scenario above
- Performance on huge datasets
- Mobile layout (desktop-first for now)

---

## How to give me the feedback

Whatever's easiest for you — pick one:

- **Comments on this doc** if I share it as a Google Doc (best for inline notes as you read)
- **A WhatsApp voice note** as you go ("just hit X and it was confusing because Y")
- **A short list** at the end ("3 things that surprised me, 5 things that felt missing")
- **The call** when you've formed an opinion — 15-20 min

No formal report. The rougher the notes, the better.

---

## Time expectation

Around 1–2 hours of testing spread over a few days. No deadline. No pressure to use it daily.

## How to reach me

- **WhatsApp:** [+20-115-638-4000]
- **Email:** mohamed.algazzar@gmail.com

For anything that blocks you (can't sign in, OAuth fails, page won't load) — WhatsApp, fastest. For everything else, just save it for the wrap-up.

---

## A note on data privacy

It's a test environment. Data lives in a managed PostgreSQL database with row-level isolation — no other Nxentra user can see your data. If you want me to wipe your tenant when you're done, I'll do it within 24h of your request.

Looking forward to your read.
